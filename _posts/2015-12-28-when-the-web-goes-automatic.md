As a designer we all have wondered can designing for the web get any easier? There has to be a better way.

Well, in stepped The Grid IO. I signed up as a founder over a year ago. They sold me the dream I was hoping for and I bit. Since then they have been developing and sending updates every so often. It all, till today, has been shrouded in a mysterious way as to how this site builder would work. 

Honestly, I have no idea what site I'm going to build with this but I am going to give this thing a run for the money. Super excited to see this whole thing work.

Step 1\. - Create a site. Check  
Step 2\. - Make a post. Doing that.

Let's see what happens next;)

Till then,
